# Gene Co-Expression Analysis

A summer attachment project in Marek Mutwil's lab in NTU.

The project takes available online RNA-seq data for Canabis Sativa from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) to analysis gene co-expression from Kallisto output. We measured Pearson Correlation between different genes to find highly co-related genes in the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway to determine expression patterns. Output of the Ribosomal genes Correlation is used for quality control. The output can be visualised on CytoScape for further analysis.
