# Gene-CoExpression-Analysis

A summer attachment project to Marek Mutwil's lab in NTU.

The project takes available online RNA-seq data for Canabis Sativa from Sequence Read Archive (SRA) to analysis gene co-expression from Kallisto output. We measured Pearson Correlation between different genes to find highly co-related genes in the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway to determine expression patterns.
